# corsika-output-pyreader

Python modules to read Cherenkov photons sub-blocks from CORSIKA standard output taking both CERnnnnnn and steering card files as input arguments.

The goal is to split the "reader.py" script into several modules

So far only tested for CORSIKA Version 7.6300 (https://web.ikp.kit.edu/corsika/usersguide/usersguide.pdf) with just CERENKOV option enabled for grids of Cherenkov detectors at the ground. 

Not implemented for IACT option yet.
