# corsika-output-pyreader

Python modules to read Cherenkov photons subblocks from CORSIKA standard output taking CERnnnnnn and steering card files as input arguments.

So far only tested for CORSIKA Version 7.6300 (https://web.ikp.kit.edu/corsika/usersguide/usersguide.pdf) with just CERENKOV option enabled for grids of Cherenkov detectors at the ground. 

Not implemented for IACT option yet.
